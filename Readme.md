### Project Status: [Completed]

### Project Objective
We have been hired by a community forum to analyse crime incidents occurring at New York City (NYC) parks. This is in support of their efforts to lobby for safer parks. We need to design an attention-grabbing visualisation which they will use to motivate for more police patrols in NYC public parks.

We are required to analyse the crime incidents reported to the New York Police Department (NYPD), which have occurred at NYC parks during the first quarter of 2018. We are also required to build a visualisation within Tableau to enable the analysis of average salary across industries for the State of New York.
